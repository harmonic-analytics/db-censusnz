This package contains datasets of responses to the 2006, 2013 and 2018 NZ Censuses grouped by different geographic areas. This package is designed to be used as a data package for the __censusnz__ package, which will provide functions for accessing and interacting with the data.

## Installation

To install this package from gitlab, you must first generate a Personal Access
Token; the package can then be installed using via the Remotes package (replacing `GITLAB_PAT` with your Personal Access Token):

```r
remotes::install_gitlab(repo = 'harmonic/databases/db-censusnz', host = 'gitlab.harmonic.co.nz/', auth_token = GITLAB_PAT)
```

Alternatively the `utilic` package can be used:

```r
utilic::install_harmonic('harmonic/databases/db-censusnz')
```

In future, this package will be installed automatically with the __censusnz__ package automatically.
