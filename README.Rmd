This package contains datasets of responses to the 2006, 2013 and 2018 NZ Censuses grouped by different geographic areas. This package is designed to be used as a data package for the __censusnz__ package, which will provide functions for accessing and interacting with the data.

## Installation

This package can be installed using via the `remotes` package:

```r
remotes::install_github(repo = 'harmonic-analytics/db-censusnz')
```

In future, this package will be installed automatically with the __censusnz__ package automatically.
