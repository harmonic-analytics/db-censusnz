This package contains datasets of responses to the 2018 NZ Census
grouped by different geographic areas. This package is designed to be
used as a data package for the **censusnz** package, which will provide
functions for accessing and interacting with the data.

## Installation

This package can be installed using via the `remotes` package:

``` r
remotes::install_github(repo = 'harmonic-analytics/db-censusnz')
```

In future, this package will be installed automatically with the
**censusnz** package automatically.
