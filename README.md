This package contains datasets of responses to the 2006, 2013 and 2018
NZ Censuses grouped by different geographic areas. This package is
designed to be used as a data package for the **censusnz** package,
which will provide functions for accessing and interacting with the
data.

## Installation

This package can be installed using via the `remotes` package:

``` r
remotes::install_github(repo = 'harmonic-analytics/db-censusnz')
```

In future, this package will be installed automatically with the
**censusnz** package automatically.
